## Installation

To install ProChatPlugin, you can use npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install prochatplugin
```

or

```bash
yarn add prochatplugin
```

## Usage

To use ProChatPlugin in your React.js application, follow these steps:

1. Import the ProChatPlugin component:

   ```javascript
   import ProChatPlugin from 'prochatplugin';
   ```

2. Place the `<ProChatPlugin />` component in your desired location within your React component hierarchy:

   ```javascript
   function App() {
     return (
       <div>
         {/* Other components */}
         <ProChatPlugin />
       </div>
     );
   }
   ```

3. Customize the plugin's behavior and appearance by passing props to the `<ProChatPlugin />` component. For example, to specify the ChatGPT API endpoint and enable rich messaging:

   ```javascript
   function App() {
     return (
       <div>
         {/* Other components */}
         <ProChatPlugin
           apiEndpoint="https://api.chatgpt.com"
           enableRichMessaging={true}
         />
       </div>
     );
   }
   ```

4. Handle events and user interactions by providing event callbacks:

   ```javascript
   function handleUserMessage(message) {
     // Handle user message here
   }

   function handleChatInitialized() {
     // Chat initialized event handling
   }

   function App() {
     return (
       <div>
         {/* Other components */}
         <ProChatPlugin
           onUserMessage={handleUserMessage}
           onInitialized={handleChatInitialized}
         />
       </div>
     );
   }
   ```
